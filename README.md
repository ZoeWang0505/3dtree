# Getting Started with 3Dtree

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

There are four functions to test with:

1. change depth
2. change branch number
3. turn on "add Branch" mode, hover on any branch, the one be hovered with be highlighted.
    Click on the branch you will see a new childbranch added on it.
    this function need to be turn on because normal left mouse click is rotation mode.
4. click "PLAY" to run the animation. click "STOP" to stop the animation.


### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
